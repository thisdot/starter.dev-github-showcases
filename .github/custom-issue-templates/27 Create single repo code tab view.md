# Create single repo code tab view

## Background

As a user, by default when I navigate to a single repository I land on the code tab. Here I can see the folders and files found in the root directory of the repo and the name of the root branch. I can also see the repoâ€™s readme file below the folder tree.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Branch button with icon, name of root branch, and dropdown arrow (does not need to show other branches yet)
- [ ] show root folder directories and files (relates to issue for folder navigation)

## Notes
