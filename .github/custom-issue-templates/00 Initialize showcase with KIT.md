# Initialize showcase with KIT

## Background

As a developer, I would like my starting base to be the existing KIT for the current technology. It is expected for a KIT to be fully ready before commencing work on the showcase.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Import the KIT
- [ ] Follow the instruction in the README to modify required data (ex title, name, description)
- [ ] If you find anything missing or wrong in the KIT, raise a Ticket (even if it is just a high risk update in the package.json)
