# Create single repo pull request tab view

## Background

As a user, if I click into the pull requests tab for a repository, I can see a list of cards containing information about PRs for this repo. By default I land on the view for open PRs, and can click on the words “open” or “closed” to change if I see currently open or closed PRs. 

## Acceptance

- [ ] section header shows:
    - [ ] {number} open with icon
    - [ ] {number} closed with icon
    - [ ] label dropdown (does not need options)
    - [ ] sort dropdown (does not need options)
- [ ] body shows either open or closed (depending on which is selected) pull request cards
- [ ] pagination navigation - < prev next > (does not need to function yet)
