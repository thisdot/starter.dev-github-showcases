# Setup organization page layout

## Background

As a user, I can view a page for any organiziation I have available, which will show that organizationâ€™s list of repositories. I can also see options to search my repositories, sort them, and filter them. (Functionality does not need to work yet for these options, they just need to be visible.)

## Acceptance

- [ ] 1 column layout
- [ ] sub-header spanning both columns, showing book icon and repositories title - should be sticky on scroll
- [ ] Top of main section - search / filter / sort component
- [ ] Main section - card for all org repos
