# Scaffold initial project setup for {{ TECHSTACK }}

## Background

Each new showcase is intended to create guidelines and best practices for architecting a new solution using the given technologies. Establishing and configuring those key technologies will be essential for anyone else contributing to this stack. We also want tests and a Storybook established for each project as well.

## Acceptance


- [ ] setup project
- [ ] setup styles
- [ ] setup testing
- [ ] setup Storybook
- [ ] setup data fetching library (if applicable)
- [ ] setup state manager (if applicable)
- [ ] add README

## Notes

 - Each project should live in its own sub directory
 - The directory should be named `<scaffolding tool/library/framework>-<fetch library/state manager>-<styling tool>`
 - README should cover setup instructions
