# Create profile page layout

## Background

As a user, I can navigate to my profile page and see my profile information, as well as a list of all my repositories. I can also see options to search my repositories, sort them, and filter them. (Functionality does not need to work yet for these options, they just need to be visible.)

## Acceptance

- [ ] 2 column layout
- [ ] sub-header spanning both columns, showing book icon and repositories title - should be sticky on scroll
- [ ] Left side
    - [ ] user profile card
- [ ] Right side - 
    - [ ] search / filter / sort component
    - [ ] card for all user repositories
