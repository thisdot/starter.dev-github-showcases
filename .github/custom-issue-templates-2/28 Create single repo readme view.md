# Create single repo readme view

## Background

As a user, by default when I navigate to a single repository I land on the code tab. Here I can see the folders and files found in the root directory of the repo and the name of the root branch. I can also see the repoâ€™s readme file below the folder tree.

## Acceptance

- [ ] show root readme.md file with list icon next to the title
