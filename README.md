# starter.dev GitHub Showcases

Welcome to stater.dev GitHub Showcases! Here you can see some of the projects that we've built using a variety of technologies to demonstrate architectural patterns and best practices using these tools.

See some of the projects we've built:

## Showcase Implementations

### Features, behaviors, styles, and GraphQL query reference

If you're working on a new showcase you should refer to **[next-react-query-tailwind](/next-react-query-tailwind)** as the point of reference. Each implementation should
match each other closely when it comes to features, behavior, and styling. If you're unsure about something or notice any discrepancies, refer to **next-react-query-tailwind** as the source of truth. The specifics of the actual implementation will vary, especially since they are built with a variety of different technologies, but they should all look and behave the same.

### REST API reference

If the showcase that you're working on is using the GitHub REST API, you should refer
to the **[angular-ngrx](/angular-ngrx)** showcase as a reference for fetching the data required to implement each feature.
