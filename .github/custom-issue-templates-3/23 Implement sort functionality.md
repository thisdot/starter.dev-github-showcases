# Implement sort functionality

## Background

In another ticket, a component was created with the sort dropdown button. The purpose of this ticket is to add the functionality and populate the fields for that button. The options that should be available to the user are listed below - when a user selects an option, the repository list on the page should be sorted to match the selection the user made.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Sort options: 
    - [ ] last updated (default) - most recent first 
    - [ ] name - Z-A 
    - [ ] stars - most to least
- [ ] only one selection allowed, noted with a check mark icon
