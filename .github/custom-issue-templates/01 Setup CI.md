# Setup CI for new project

## Background

We want to review changes in as near real-time as possible. The goal of this is to set up guard rails for development practices and validate features as theyâ€™re completed.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Setup linting
- [ ] Setup Unit testing
- [ ] Setup build

## Notes
You can use existing [CI workflows](https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev-github-showcases/tree/main/.github/workflows) as a baseline
