# Create repository card

## Background

This will be a reusable component that displays details about a repository. On the home page and profile page, a user will see a list of their repositories. This component is intended to be the building block for that - a single card for a repository, showing pertinent data about that repo.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Card view for use on repository lists
- [ ] should always have:
    - [ ] repo name
    - [ ] visibility tag (public / private)
    - [ ] description (if available)
    - [ ] main language with color dot
    - [ ] star icon with number of stars on repo
    - [ ] last updated text
    - [ ] optional - star button on right to add a star to the repo (does not need to function yet)
