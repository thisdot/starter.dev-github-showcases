## Overview

### Featured Tech Stack

- React
- RxJS
- TypeScript

### Included Tooling

- Prettier
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- ESLint
- Styled Components

## Architectural Decisions

- Project uses `snake-case` file naming convention over traditional `PascalCase`
- Components should be contained in their own `components` directory or module folder and exported via the index file
- The following directories should be restricted to the following types of components:
  - routes: Only contains top-level page components
  - hooks: Only reusable global hooks

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the starter.dev-showcases repository from https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev-github-showcases

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev-github-showcases.git
```

### Env Setup

This project comes with a `.env.example` file.

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.starter.dev/api
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

While in the project directory, run this command in your terminal.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
