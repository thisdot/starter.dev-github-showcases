Just needs to actually be set when the UI is set up. I think that field can either be deleted from the AC or else I'll add it in when I come back.\r\n- The other unmarked fields will all require extra fetch calls, since we're using the REST API. Decisions on which we want and which we don't will need to be made. This PR isn't fully ready until those choices are made.  \r\n\r\nAcceptance criteria from ticket:\r\n\r\ndata needed:\r\n- [ ]  username\r\n- [x]  repo name\r\n- [x]  visibility badge (public / private)\r\n- [x]  watch count\r\n- [x]  star count\r\n- [x]  fork count\r\n- [x]  issue count\r\n- [ ]  pull request count\r\n- [ ]  branch names\r\n- [x]  about description\r\n- [x]  about website link (if available)\r\n- [ ]  root tree information (folders and files)\r\n- [ ]  readme information",

    "body": "Because the urls for the deploy preview and the signIn redirect (which is hard coded in the env variables) are different, the NgRx store doesn’t persist across them, and so the calls to set a user as authenticated and to store the session cookie don’t work. It’s fine locally and on the fully deployed instance since those urls will match, but will prevent the previews from letting anyone log in. \r\n\r\nWill need some discussion on how best to adjust for this for deploy previews:\r\n- Get the current url dynamically, and use that instead of hard coding the url paths?\r\n- Move the logic that saves the session cookie to a route guard or something similar, and adjust the store logic to check for the cookie first?\r\n- Move all auth logic out of the NgRx store and make it local / cookie based?\r\n\r\nNot sure the best path forward. But the deploy previews would be helpful enough for reviewing that finding a solution for this is worth figuring out.",
